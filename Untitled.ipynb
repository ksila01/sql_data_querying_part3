    "Dear President Naledi,\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this email finds you in the best of health and spirits. As you know, my team and I were tasked with conducting an independent audit of the Maji Ndogo water project, specifically the database recording water sources in our country, following the inconsistencies identified by Chidi Kunto and his team.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity, in this specific audit, our objective was to assess the integrity, and accuracy of the data stored in the database. Auditing a database involves verifying that the data it contains is both accurate and has not been tampered with, thereby ensuring that the information can be relied upon for decision-making and governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am pleased to report that the audit is now complete. After a rigorous examination of the database's records, as well as the procedures in place for data entry and modification, we can confirm that the vast majority of the data aligns with the principles of good governance and data-driven decision-making that you have so vigorously championed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we did find some data that was tampered with, which requires your immediate attention. I have attached the records I have re-examined for your review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for entrusting us with this crucial task. Your commitment to accountability and transparency is truly commendable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sincerely,\n",

    "I am heartened to learn that our operations are largely in line with our principles of governance. At the same time, your findings are valuable as they highlight areas we can further improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rest assured, I will be convening our data team to address any issues and take any steps necessary to ensure the integrity of our data.\n",
